Ask the user to type in the password.
Options for storing passwords:

Validate the user's identity as quickly as possible 

Avoid insecure passwords - easy to guess or stored in an insecure database

SSH?
Private key is never transmitted over the network, SSH runs mathematical calculations to prove that you have the right key.

In order to make it work, the database needs to be accessible by SSH - is this too complex?
